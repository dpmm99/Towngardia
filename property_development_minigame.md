# Property Development Acceleration Minigame

## Core Concept
The player manages a **Property Development Dashboard** where they can execute various "abilities" to attract tenants and speed up building upgrades. Each ability costs resources and provides different benefits, culminating in a strategic resource management minigame. The primary end result is that the residence the player selected--a house, quadplex, apartment, or highrise--gets upgraded if the player completes the minigame. Secondary effects are positive and negative area effects around the building in the main game with a radius of 3.

## Relevant facts about the main game
The main game supports these effects: PettyCrime, OrganizedCrime, PoliceProtection, ParticulatePollution, GreenhouseGases, Noise, LandValue, FireHazard, FireProtection, Education, Healthcare, BusinessPresence, Luxury, PublicTransport, BusinessValue. Of those, only FireHazard is not an *area* effect, but instead applies to a specific building.

...as well as Flunds (currency), Research, Population, and Tourists
...and some constantly produced/consumed resources, namely Power and Water.
...plus some are only available in Volcanic region cities: Obsidian, GreenObsidian, FireObsidian, Sulfur, Dynamite.

## Core Mechanics

### Minigame-Only Resources
- **Appeal Points** - how attractive the property is to tenants
- **Construction Progress** - how close the building is to upgrading
- **Reputation** - affects success rates of social abilities

### Game Flow
- **Random ability selection**: The player always has a hand of 3 abilities; upon using or banking one, another takes its place
- **One-time use**: Most abilities can only be used once per game session
- **Time pressure**: Stats slowly decay if player takes too long to decide
- **Fail condition**: If no abilities can be afforded, triggers area effects in main game

### Turn Structure
1. **Ability selection phase** - choose from current random options
2. **Effect resolution** - positive and negative effects apply
3. **Replacement** - used abilities get replaced by new random ones

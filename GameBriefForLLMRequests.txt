I've built a fun online social city builder game. It has features like the following:
Population - unlock various city services to make the complexity increase gradually, produce income tax revenue, patronize businesses to produce sales tax revenue, consume food
Tourism - supplements the population to bring businesses closer to their patronage capacities (and therefore sales tax revenue)
Technologies to be researched (building unlocks, range/efficiency upgrades, and cost reductions, and some are blocked until you build a certain structure or until an event occurs)
A deliberate slow pace (four ticks a day) and no fixed frame rate, optimized for mobile play and taking weeks to months to unlock a technology and a month or more to reach just 1000 population (the limit is closer to 50,000 if you fill the map, but it should take about 6-8 months at least)
Friends - you can visit their cities, get some free research points from them, and earn a mutual boost via a minigame that can only be played in a friend's city (but is not actually multiplayer), and for certain events, you can send them gifts (temporary bonuses)
128 buildings with some distinct footprints, such as some that must be built on each other
Businesses that take power and produce sales tax and spread 'business presence' to the area, required for higher-tier residences to appear but causing more traffic (pollution and noise)
Industries and agriculture buildings that produce different resources you have to tap to collect, and most of them consume resources you have to tap to provide them with
Government services such as fire, police, healthcare, education, storage for resources, and various types of power plant
Decorative structures that spread luxury to the area
A happiness system that considers services, luxury, land value (e.g., from natural beauty like ponds), business presence, crime, pollution, noise, power outages, etc.
Destructible objects (e.g., trash in a pond) that reveal natural resources beneath
Various events that can damage buildings and make them require repairs (also considering making some buildings deteriorate and undergo mechanical failures that need repairs, plus a tech that you can research for auto-repair)
Building info menu with funny descriptions
Upkeep costs for buildings in addition to power needs (water is pending)
Power imports for a higher price
Resource trading with a market that slowly refills to its low capacity after you buy from it
Achievements and titles (which are city-level achievements with small permanent bonus effects)
A basic traffic system just based on business presence, public transport facilities, and techs (spreading noise and particulate pollution)
A 32-step tutorial plus extra tips later
Player-level and city-level notifications
14 data views (for crime, police, fire, pollution, education, health, luxury, land value, residential desirability, business presence, etc.)
A budget where you can adjust sales tax, income tax, property tax, and service expenditures (I especially need more things to be affected by the Environment services slider)
It has these resources: Concrete, Glass, Iron, Bricks, Clay, Lumber, Steel, Stone, Wood, Coal, Copper, Gemstones, Lithium, Oil, Plastics, Rubber, Sand, Silicon, Textiles, Tritium, Uranium, Apps, Batteries, Clothing, Electronics, Furniture, Paper, Pharmaceuticals, Toys, Flunds (money), and the gifts for events are Chocolate, Brain Brews, Glee Grenades, Turbo Tonics
These resources are unused (can just be bought and sold): rubber, clay, bricks, lumber, and pharmaceuticals can be produced and used for just one or two research items
And it has 13 types of food on top of that, which are used to feed the citizens (affects health and happiness depending on the types of food, and affects business efficiency if food is insufficient).
It has six minigames with gameplay focusing on low frame rates (e.g., one redraw per second) to save mobile battery power: sequence memory (alien themed), position memory (mixology themed), match-3-tiles (space/star themed), something like Pipe Dream (social network themed), a slot machine (rich cat themed), and a timed tower-builder that permanently adjusts various properties of your residential Skyscrapers
The minigames reward you with flunds, tourism boosts, production boosts, and/or resources.
17 events: Hauntymonth (October event that unlocks some luxury buildings temporarily), Merrymonth (similar), Chocomonth (similar), Drought, Heatwave, ColdSnap, PowerOutage, Burglary, Heist, Epidemic, Fire, Earthquake, Riot, Spoilage, EconomicBoom, EmergencyPowerAid, and UrbanRenewalGrant; also considering SolarStorm, LightningStrike, Aurora, MeteorShower, SpringBloom, FoodFestival

Residences appear on their own, or can even upgrade to higher tiers, and they control the population level. You can demolish them if needed, and you can also demolish natural obstacles on the map for a price, but you can only 'stash' buildings that you directly constructed (saving them for later, never selling or destroying).
I'm planning to add some alternative regions to the game, as the players can only play in the Plains region now, but ideas include Tundra, Ancient Ocean, Volcanic Yard, and Delta.
More interesting buildings include: Data Center unlocks some high-tech research. Weather Control Machine reduces bad weather events' duration. Quantum Computing Lab randomly gives research progress. College gives some research points daily plus can have two Dorms built on it. Convention Center gives a tourism boost for a few days every time it switches events. Game Dev Studio produces one Apps a day and has a different patronage formula. Furniture Store boosts residents' chance to move in but you have to spend Furniture to keep it going. Post Office gives a small global boost to businesses and reduction to traffic. Hot Spring Inn spreads luxury and brings in tourism. The Sand Collector, Hot Spring Inn, Lithium Mine, Iron Mine, Crystal Mine, Oil Derrick, and Geothermal Power Plant have to be built on natural resources. Oil Truck, Coal Truck, Nuclear Fuel Truck, and Fusion Fuel Truck have to be built on the appropriate power plants. I'm also considering Minigame Research Lab to adjust minigame rewards, Distribution Center to convert some resources directly into happiness, Community Center with some swappable area bonuses, Healthcare Research Center that slowly grows a permanent healthcare bonus, Space Tours (business) and Orbital Habitat (residence) and Orbital Collector (makes tritium) that would all have to be placed on top of Space Launch Site, complexes like a strip mall (place various businesses in its slots) and a theme park (a few different kinds of rides on a fixed-size base) and a university campus (a few different kinds of buildings, similarly), Environmental Lab to slowly shrink pollution production rates, Energy Institute to increase power efficiency, Advanced Recycling Center to produce some random resources, Molecular Assembler to produce high-tier resources, and Mobile Clinics to spread healthcare to individual tiles that aren't in a clinic's/hospital's area. Another idea is a tractor beam to pull down asteroids for a chance to damage buildings but a lot of resources.
I'm also considering letting players earn 'wisdom points' to spend on 'care packages'--resources, resource discounts, research speed boosts, and/or temporary building unlocks for newer players.

Things I'd rather not have: many small connected structures like trains or hyperloops, culture-oriented events, city ordinances or laws or diplomacy, overly similar minigames, animations of any sort, water or sewer or trash or recycling (at least for now).

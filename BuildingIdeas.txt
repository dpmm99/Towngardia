...Military things
...endless types of factory, shop, business, and government versions of things (e.g., government-provided housing, welfare office, homeless shelter)
...could also have current cutting-edge tech like carbon capture plants (negative pollution) and centrifugal air purifiers. Carbon pollution could say "doesn't have immediate health effects, but a portion of the population is happier knowing they're contributing to the planet's health long-term." And noise barriers.

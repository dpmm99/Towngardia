Needs its own container: Water



...Military things
...endless types of factory, shop, business, and government versions of things (e.g., government-provided housing, welfare office, homeless shelter)
...could also have current cutting-edge tech like carbon capture plants (negative pollution) and centrifugal air purifiers. Carbon pollution could say "doesn't have immediate health effects, but a portion of the population is happier knowing they're contributing to the planet's health long-term." And noise barriers.

*** could require there to be enough factories/businesses to supply all citizens (so you need more as the city grows) in order for there to be any surplus for you to use directly for the city
***** That's a great idea for ensuring larger cities don't automatically mean you have a ton of disposable income from excess resources
I did like the timer-based factories and such in SimCity BuildIt, but they need to allow stocking up 5 days worth of resources before they stop producing.

There will definitely be events... especially at the convention center, like anime conventions, comic cons, even garbage like NASCAR...
*** could have both sims and bots more like Timberborn and Surviving Mars... biomes of fire, ice, jungle, ocean, river, etc.

** Then we need a "service" class to manage all buildings that fall under that service--that's where the player's budget adjustment (0.9, 1.0, or 1.1) would be.
** A class for each window (budget, building stock, control bar, info, tutorials, etc), for each view (city layer, the several types of pollution, crime, minigames, etc), for each control (range-slider)...
** Maybe a market service--to handle storage and calculation of resource buy and sell prices and availability
** Maybe a techtree class to handle the research progress, techs that you are currently allowed to research, past unlocks, adoption progress and speed...

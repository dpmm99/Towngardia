Towngardia: Isometric social city sim game (mobile-friendly, browser-based, and absolutely no microtransactions).
Over 100 building types (many factories, businesses, city services, public utilities, decorations, infrastructure--but no power lines; roads and buildings transfer power)
Over 50 resource types (including funds, happiness, population, apples, grain, root vegetables, silicon, iron, steel, etc.)
Techs with variable adoption rates (by researching, you can unlock buildings, upgrades, and access to research more techs; many techs take a while to be fully adopted by the populace)
Titles and achievements (similar, but titles are at the City level and with permanent effects, while achievements are at the Player level and only for brownie points).
Trade (import power as needed automatically, and the player has settings to auto-trade other types of resources, e.g., auto-buy up to the given warehouse capacity percentage when provisioning resources to buildings, auto-sell when collecting unless stock gets below some percent)
Long and short ticks (long ticks are 4x daily, affecting resource production/consumption, but power usage and road connectivity are based on short ticks, which occur every 5 minutes)
Manual collection and provisioning of resources (player has to interact with factories/businesses occasionally for them to function, but buildings will stock up to 5 days worth; player has options for 1 tap to provide 1 Long Tick's worth, 1 day's worth, or 5 days' worth on a per-resource-type basis)
Events (seasons that affect crop growth by type, holidays that may affect decorations and happiness, market events like economic booms/slumps and tradeable resource shortages, and disasters like snow accumulation, storms, and epidemics)
Optional minigames (rate-limited so you can only play so many in a time period, with effects [much like events] such as a short-term tourism boost or increased tech adoption rate, but some minigames you can play to help your friends' cities as well)
Happiness-oriented local conditions (several types of pollution, several types of crime, land value, etc.)
City data views (to see population distribution, sources and concentrations of pollution, etc.)
Budgets (one or a few types of tax, expenditures per service type, but the player only has a little control over each so it's easier for us to balance the income, trade prices, and service costs)
Direct construction, corporate enticement, and automatic formation (the player selects where most buildings go, some they may pay for but are effectively just making a fixed-size zone for a specific type of business to ask them to move in, and residents build homes and come and go as they please)
Nature exploitation (each player picks a region for their city, and regions have different natural resources, particularly rare ones; also, players must unlock areas within the region to expand their cities or to reach certain resources)
Loss prevention (if the player does poorly and gets into negative funds, they can't build or buy resources, and city services also auto-downsize to try to keep enough population but low enough expenses to make the budget a net positive; city services also operate cheaper if they don't HAVE to be running at full steam, even if you're rich)
Other central design decisions: 'addictive' over a long time scale, meant to be played across months to years, but not encouraging addictive behaviors like missing out on gains if you don't play daily; always-running and constantly-saving like an MMO, not like a single-player game. Keep players from becoming rich AND let players ease into things by increasing building costs as the city grows, making citizens demand more services for the same amount of happiness as population grows, and maybe other means. None of the titles and achievements are things you would easily get without intentionally aiming for them.

One of the minigames will be a clone of that game Mom liked in the 90s/00s, Jewelbox. It's basically Tetris, but the falling blocks are always 3 in a line with 2-3 different jewel types, and any 3-in-a-row match disappears and the remaining ones obey gravity. Could be a speed game, but it's a matter of how fast you complete it instead of racing against falling blocks, perhaps making controls a bit easier.

Might want a milestone chart that shows your current population and the next few unlocks. (e.g., population is 1 at the start, and it shows 50=food production, 100=police, 200=fire.)
Tourism would be unlocked by having a few commercial establishments.
Could even have an alien structure that lets you play minigames on occasion to get a resource you can't get any other way.
Could have events that make you change your city layout a bit, like "a hot spring opened up at this location, so you should build a resort there."

Could require there to be enough factories/businesses to supply all citizens (so you need more as the city grows) in order for there to be any surplus for you to use directly for the city
- That's a great idea for ensuring larger cities don't automatically mean you have a ton of disposable income from excess resources

Regions could be like... ancient ocean: more oil, sand, maybe coal and crystals. Delta: more swamps and coal or something. Tundra: nothing useful and perpetual winter (no heatwaves)? Volcanic yard with a lot of copper and iron?

Disaster ideas:
Close call - fission power plant has to shut down for a day to repair after the safety triggered

Prompt for UI icons:
Four clean images, ICON OBJECTS GO HERE, style of a mostly flat (slightly 3D, slightly cartoony) software icon, plain black background
Prompt for buildings:
XYZ building, in the style of a detailed 3D realistic cartoon isometric city sim, no background or shadows around the tile, omnidirectional lighting, fitting completely in frame, plain black background
Prompt for rooms in Altitect (but I varied it a lot):
Two images, one on top of the other, depicting a cutaway of a XYZ room, in the style of a detailed realistic cartoon side-scrolling sidescroller cutaway tower game, elongated, ordinary lighting, just one room fitting completely in frame, orthographic perspective, flat projection, direct horizontal side view from floor level, seen from straight on, plain black background



Main remaining features:
Regions (ancient ocean, delta, tundra, volcanic yard)
aaand probably being able to buy things (particularly the resources that aren't in every region) more easily if your friends are selling them. I was thinking sales go into a list for 5 days, but then you have to load and affect the other players' city data...
Otherwise, I'm pretty well down to just making buildings, events, techs (though I already have 31), and titles/achievements. 



Coolest open ideas:
Sort businesses by patron value (or maybe do a fixed sort order for all building types, but need an indicator to show which ones are newly unlocked)
In medium to large cities (>~15% map coverage), I really need tourism to be more meaningful and taxes to have some diminishing returns--after playing for 1.5 months, I'm earning a surplus of 2k a day but have >1700 citizens with nowhere to shop, not to mention the completely untapped tourists. Current ideas for fixing that:
	double businesses' customer capacities
	a "basements" tech to further increase businesses' customer capacities (and value, but not quite proportionally, maybe like 0.5x-0.8x as much)
	lower business value (flunds per customer), mainly just tightening the range
	make services more expensive for bigger residences (a skyscraper holds 78x as many people as a small house, so why not at least have, say, 30x the service costs?)
	make education costs scale like other services (and maybe unlock it just a bit later so the increase isn't harmful to the early game)
	apply a diminishing returns formula to income tax (maybe the first residents are all rich and the later immigrants get more and more poor and there's a standard deduction ;))
	give tourism a second effect, like increasing patronage caps a bit or allowing a fraction of tourism to exceed the patronage caps
	make better buildings more expensive, especially the businesses--I have a surplus of 2k a day in my city, so costs in the thousands for mid-tier buildings should be fine
	make research also cost a lot of flunds, like 100x the research points for early techs and 1000x for later techs
	more negative events, such as implementing the mechanical failures idea I listed below
	could also make some techs decrease the spawn chance/limit and increase costs (at least those that aren't specifically meant to do the opposite):
		Vacuum Insulated Windows, Smart Home Systems, Rooftop Solar Panels, Hydroponic Gardens could slightly reduce move-in rates (with the excuse that it's more expensive or people don't want to deal with those things)
		Hydroponic Gardens would increase residential power usage
		Advanced Robotics would increase factory upkeep and power usage
		Food Service Robots would increase patron cap (and could also increase business presence) but increase value less than proportionally
		AI Driven Logistics would increase warehouse power usage and upkeep
		Telemedicine Infrastructure, VR Classrooms, Nanomedicine Research, Brain-Computer Interface could all increase service upkeep costs
	minigame reward upgrades--spend a lot of flunds for a small increase to the non-flunds rewards from a minigame
	more services--other than water and trash that I still intended to eventually add, there could be cemeteries, homeless shelters, courthouses, employment offices, intelligence agencies, military, occasional grant requests from colleges, consumer and environment protection agencies, scholarship programs...
	minigame upgrade: pay flunds to allow using 2 or 3 tokens at once in Monobrynth and make the grid 1 column more narrow per additional token + remove the lowest remaining difficulty level
Advisor button that suggests what your city needs the most--businesses, factories, services, decorations, time, space, spread, research, friends, minigame skill, less road, special unlocks
new techs:
	incubators - greatly increases all costs/effects of ranches, fish farms, and carnicultivators
new events:
	solar storm (increases solar power)
	aurora (tourism)
	spring bloom (agriculture boost)
	meteor shower (research boost)
	lightning strike (just damages one to a few random buildings)
	social events
	perfect weather (Claude suggested "clear skies week" = solar power + happiness, "perfect growing conditions" = agriculture)
	food festival (happiness + business)
	February event: a "chocolate bar" that acts like a Bar but also produces the 'chocolate' resource, luxury flower tower, and a heart monument that directly increases residence spawn chance (Hearty Shack)
new buildings:
	I mainly need more mid-tier businesses (better than Greg's Grogg B'Arr and worse than Resort Hotel)
	maybe a building that can be placed on roads to reduce nearby residential power consumption (and even then, maybe only in summer) - could be a solar panel or just a vegetation trellis or whatever
	big complexes:
		Cheap strip mall you can place a bunch of small businesses on
		theme park that you can place a bunch of separate components on (roller coaster, ferris wheel, 6D adventure, etc.)
		university campus you can place a bunch of facilities on
	space tours (business), orbital habitat, orbital collector (for tritium) that would all have to be placed on top of the space launch site (maybe like 1-3 slots per launch site) - I listed these in the buildings file, too, but I like these ideas enough to merit making them before just about any other building in that file
	Healthcare Research Center - does its own research, very slowly growing a permanent healthcare bonus even if you remove it
	Community Center - swappable bonuses (fitness classes, workshops, social events, whatever)
	Free Stuff Table/Distribution Center could have more options - instead of just happiness, could be healthcare, education, research, traffic reduction, luxury, etc.
	Social Sciences Center - happiness research
	Bamboo Thicket - produces more wood using less space (maybe unlocked with GM crops or as another tech after it)
	Advanced Recycling Center - converts waste to basic resources - could just produce some random resources based on the nearby building count
	Molecular Assembler - slow high-tier resource generation
	Mobile Clinics - spreads healthcare to underserved areas, i.e., it might not be a square/rounded-rectangle AoE
	Preventive Care Center - reduces healthcare costs over time (could be a tech instead, though)
	Emergency Response Center - reduces event impact, but this would make more sense if there were negative health events even when you have good healthcare coverage
	Innovation Hub - could turn Apps into research or something
	Supply Chain Center - production efficiency, e.g., could boost business patron cap and proportionally boost business revenue
	Air quality monitoring and enforcement center - reduces pollution from nearby structures
	Other environment building ideas: wildlife sanctuary (+tourism), ecosystem restoration center (improves land value)
	More specific decorations: bronze dragon, giant wind instrument, giant steampunk chess set, plaza that looks like a compass rose, fancy bike path that both reduces traffic and spreads luxury, human-sized hamster wheels (maybe spreads a little healthcare and produces 0.1 MW for the laughs :))
Mechanical failures - a few buildings would damage themselves slowly over time and show a wrench icon instead of fire when they're damaged, but the damage wouldn't harm efficiency for 5 days, then the backdrop turns from the 'warning' one into the 'error' one after that. A tech could unlock auto-repair. Could apply to all factories and high-traffic businesses starting at 2k population or something like that as a flunds sink, but factories would go back to not being worth having if you don't need the output resources.
Disasters like snow accumulation, fission 'close call', lightning strike that only damages one building
Make city progress -> earn wisdom points -> buy care packages you can send to newer players, e.g., temporary building unlocks, resources or discounts, research speed
Community projects - like research, but not just spending resources, and different kinds of rewards?
Possible multi-friend project: Intercity Trade Center (permanently reduces market buy prices)
Some possible minigame rewards: factory booster - can boost a single factory's output by 25% for a day or something; land value booster - permanently increase land value a little bit (with a limit); temporary construction cost reduction; temporary market buy price reduction
Possible minigame reward for a friend: Expert Consulting (temporary business efficiency boost)
Another minigame idea: like a 'bulldozer' game but with trash and it's really just a match-3 kind of thing. Could produce paper (which could be required by the post office)
Another minigame idea: cryptograms that boost education and use paper, maybe occasionally lead to buried treasure or something ;)
"corporate enticement"
construction image until a building activates
convention center with its own MEANINGFUL events (they just cause a temporary tourism increase as-is)
...water. Beaches, marinas, dredgers, fishing ships, cruise ships, luaus, lighthouses
business categories so people can be assigned to multiple types of business instead of just one each
"authorizing" buildings to change behavior (I forget exactly what I was thinking early this morning, but I thought it was cool then ;) probably allowing pharmaceutical auto-use at hospitals or something, but that wouldn't have any impact since health benefits cap at 1 anyway)
make certain buildings change the adjacent road tiles' variants to show trucks on them (or make them draw an overlay just like the collectible/provisioning overlays)
space launch site or a tractor beam can be set to pull asteroids down to the ground, giving more resources but risking damaging nearby buildings
timeline of city achievements/milestones preferably with screenshots
make research points and random resources always useful by adding a few repeatable research items that each increase the market supply of a set of resources, e.g., +1 supply per 25 points + 10 surplus items
(highly unlikely I would do this) underground city

Underused/unused resources:
toys could be a regional or citywide effect minigame wherein you distribute them (also distributed to increase happiness via Free Stuff Tables now)
rubber for cars (plus batteries though they aren't unused), but dunno
Unused and unproduceable: clay, bricks, paper, rubber, lumber... dunno. (but paper is distributed to increase happiness via Free Stuff Tables now)
Tritium can only be obtained as high-end minigame rewards. (but I made a couple minigames able to more reliably produce larger amounts of it)
pharmaceuticals for health (also distributed to increase happiness via Free Stuff Tables now)
